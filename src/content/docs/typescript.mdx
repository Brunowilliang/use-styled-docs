description: Understand how use-styled utilizes TypeScript's type inference for a safe and productive development experience.

`use-styled` was built with TypeScript in mind, leveraging its features to the fullest to offer type safety and autocompletion (IntelliSense) during development.

## Automatic Prop Inference

The main magic of `use-styled` lies in its ability to **automatically infer the props accepted by the base component** you pass as the first argument. This means that within the `base` and `variants` sections of the configuration object, you will have type-safe access to all the props that the original component would accept.

Let's look at a practical example in React Native:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, type ViewProps } from 'react-native';
import { useStyled } from 'use-styled';

// --- Example 1: Component with Typed Props ---

// Wrapper component that accepts all props of a View
const ComponentWithProps = (props: ViewProps) => {
	return <View {...props} />;
};

export const StyledComponentWithProps = useStyled(ComponentWithProps, {
	base: {
		// ✅ OK: ViewProps are available here!
		accessibilityLabel: 'Base Label',
    // onLayout: () => {},
    // style: { backgroundColor: 'blue' },
    // etc...
	},
	variants: {
		testVariant: {
			a: {
				// ✅ OK: ViewProps also available here!
        collapsable: false,
        // style: { opacity: 0.8 }
			},
		},
	},
});

// --- Example 2: Component WITHOUT Defined Props ---

// Simple component that doesn't declare accepting props
const ComponentWithoutProps = () => {
	return <View />;
};

export const StyledComponentWithoutProps = useStyled(ComponentWithoutProps, {
	base: {
		// ❌ Error: No View props are available here!
		// accessibilityLabel: 'Error',
    // Trying to add any prop here will cause a type error.
	},
	variants: {
		testVariant: {
			a: {
        // ❌ Error: No View props here either.
        // collapsable: true,
      },
		},
	},
});
```

**How does it work?**

The `useStyled` hook uses TypeScript Generics. It inspects the type of the first argument (`component`) and extracts its `Props`. These `Props` (minus the variant props you define) are then used to type what is allowed within `base` and each variant definition.

*   In `Example 1`, `ComponentWithProps` has the type `(props: ViewProps) => JSX.Element`. `useStyled` extracts `ViewProps`, which is why `accessibilityLabel`, `style`, `collapsable`, etc., are valid within the configuration.
*   In `Example 2`, `ComponentWithoutProps` has the type `() => JSX.Element`. Since it doesn't declare any props, `useStyled` infers an empty object (`{}`) for the allowed props in the configuration, resulting in errors if you try to pass props like `accessibilityLabel`.

**Conclusion:** To get the most out of IntelliSense and type safety, **always ensure that your base component has its props correctly typed** (whether it's an intrinsic component like `'div'` or `'button'`, or a custom functional component).
