## Acknowledgements

Software development is a collaborative and iterative process. `use-styled` would not exist without the incredible work of other people and projects in the open-source community. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to:

*   **`class-variance-authority` (cva)** by Joe Bell: For popularizing a robust and type-safe way to handle class variants.
*   **`tailwind-variants`** by Junior Garcia and Tianen Pang: For expanding the CVA concept with a rich API, including `base`, `variants`, `compoundVariants`, and `defaultVariants`, which directly influenced the features of `use-styled`.
*   **`Tamagui`** by Nate: For its innovative and elegant approach to creating universal styled components (React/React Native), which served as the main inspiration for the API and developer experience (DX) of `use-styled`.

Thank you to Joe, Junior, Tianen, and Nate for their significant contributions that make the development ecosystem richer and more productive.
