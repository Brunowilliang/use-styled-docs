title: useSlot for Compound Components
description: Create complex and intuitive component APIs with the Compound Components pattern using useSlot.
---

The `useSlot` hook is a powerful tool for creating **Compound Components** declaratively and organizedly. It allows grouping several related subcomponents under a main component, resulting in more expressive and easier-to-use APIs.

## The Problem: Managing Complex Components

Often, we need to build UI components composed of several distinct but logically connected parts. Think of a `Card` (with `Card.Header`, `Card.Body`, `Card.Footer`) or an application `Header` (with `Left`, `Center`, `Right` sections).

Traditionally, implementing this could involve:

*   Exporting multiple components separately (`Header`, `HeaderLeft`, `HeaderRight`, ...), which can pollute the namespace.
*   Using `React.Context` for implicit communication between parts, which can add complexity.
*   Passing components as props, which can make the usage API less intuitive.

## The Solution: `useSlot` for Compound Components

`useSlot` offers a different and elegant approach. You define a configuration object where the keys represent the "slots" (the parts of your compound component) and the values are the React components (or styled components with `useStyled`) that should render in each slot.

`useSlot` then returns a main component that has the slot components **attached as static properties**. This allows for intuitive syntax like `MyComponent.SlotA` or `MyComponent.SlotB.SubSlot`.

## Complete Example: A `Card` Component

Let's see how to create a `Card` component composed of a `Header` (with `Title`), `Body`, and `Footer` using `useStyled` for styling and `useSlot` for the compound structure.

**1. Define Base/Styled Components:**

First, we create the components that will represent each visual part of our Card using `useStyled`.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useStyled, useSlot } from 'use-styled';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'; // Or 'div', 'h2', 'p' for web

// --- Base Component Definitions ---

// The main Card container
const CardRoot = useStyled(View, {
  base: {
    className: 'border border-gray-300 rounded-lg shadow-md overflow-hidden bg-white',
    // style: { borderColor: '#ccc', ... } // RN style
  },
  variants: {
    shadowSize: {
      sm: { className: 'shadow-sm' },
      md: { className: 'shadow-md' },
      lg: { className: 'shadow-lg' },
    }
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    shadowSize: 'md',
  }
});

// The Header section
const CardHeader = useStyled(View, {
  base: {
    className: 'px-4 py-3 border-b border-gray-200 bg-gray-50',
  },
});

// The title within the Header
const CardTitle = useStyled(Text, {
  base: {
    className: 'text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800',
  },
});

// The main body of the Card
const CardBody = useStyled(View, {
  base: {
    className: 'p-4',
  },
});

// Default text within the Card body
const CardBodyText = useStyled(Text, {
  base: {
    className: 'text-gray-700', // Default style for body text
  },
  variants: {
    muted: {
      true: { className: 'text-gray-500 text-sm' } // Optional variant for 'muted' text
    }
  }
});

// The Card footer
const CardFooter = useStyled(View, {
  base: {
    className: 'px-4 py-3 border-t border-gray-200 bg-gray-50',
  },
});
```

**2. Create the `Card` Compound Component with `useSlot`:**

We group the components defined above into their corresponding slots using `useSlot`.

```tsx
// --- Compound Component Creation ---

// Slot for the Header and its sub-slots
export const CardHeaderSlot = useSlot(CardHeader, { // Component for <Card.Header>
  Title: CardTitle,  // Component for <Card.Header.Title>
});

// Slot for the Body and its sub-slots
export const CardBodySlot = useSlot(CardBody, { // Component for <Card.Body>
  Text: CardBodyText,  // Component for <Card.Body.Text>
});

// Main slot for the Card, using the nested slots
export const Card = useSlot(CardRoot, { // Component for <Card>
  Header: CardHeaderSlot, // Component for <Card.Header>
  Body: CardBodySlot,     // Component for <Card.Body>
  Footer: CardFooter,     // Component for <Card.Footer>
});
```

**3. Use the `Card` Compound Component:**

Usage becomes very declarative and intuitive.

```tsx
// --- Using the Card Component ---

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Card shadowSize="lg"> {/* Props are passed to Card.Root */}
      
      <Card.Header>
        {/* Props can be passed to Card.Header (CardHeader) */}
        <Card.Header.Title>
          {/* Props can be passed to Card.Header.Title (CardTitle) */}
          Card Title
        </Card.Header.Title>
      </Card.Header>

      <Card.Body>
         {/* Using the Text sub-slot */}
        <Card.Body.Text>
          This is the main content of the card.
        </Card.Body.Text>
        <Card.Body.Text muted={true} className="mt-2">
          This is secondary information.
        </Card.Body.Text>
      </Card.Body>

      <Card.Footer className="flex-row justify-end"> {/* Props are passed to Card.Footer */}
        <button className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">
          Action in Footer
        </button>
      </Card.Footer>

    </Card>
  );
}
```

This example demonstrates how `useSlot` allows building a clean and structured component API, where each part of the `Card` is accessible via static properties, while styling and internal logic are encapsulated by the base components defined with `useStyled`.

## Benefits

*   **Intuitive Usage API**: The `Component.Part.SubPart` syntax for using the component remains clear and declarative.
*   **Modular and Organized Definitions**: Each `useSlot` call defines a specific component and its direct sub-slots, leading to more focused and manageable code. Deeply nested structures are built by composing these modular slot definitions.
*   **Enhanced Reusability**: Not only can base styled components be reused, but the defined slot components (like `CardHeaderSlot`) can also be potentially reused in other compound components.
*   **Explicit Composition**: The new structure makes the composition of complex components more explicit and easier to follow, as nested slots are built by combining individual `useSlot` results.
*   **Strong Typing Capabilities**: The focused nature of each `useSlot` call can facilitate even more precise TypeScript typings for each component and its associated slots.

`useSlot` offers a powerful and declarative way to build complex UIs and keep your component APIs clean and easy to understand.
